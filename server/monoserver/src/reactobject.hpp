 *    Description: object only react to message, with an object pod
 *                 atoms of an react object:
 *                      1. before Activate(), we can call its internal method by ``this"
 *                      2. after Activate(), we can only use ReactObject::Send()
 *
 *                 In other word, after Activate(), react object can only communicate
 *                 with react object or receiver
 *
 *                 This prevent me implement MonoServer as react object. For MonoServer
 *                 it needs to manager SessionHub. However SessionHub is not an actor, so
 *                 if MonoServer is an react object, we have to launch SessionHub before
 *                 calling of MonoServer::Activate(), but, before activation of MonoServer
 *                 we don't have the address of Mo MonoServer to pass to SessionHub!
 *
 *                 In my design, SessionHub create Session's with SID and pass it to the
 *                 MonoServer, then MonoServer check info of this connection from DB and
 *                 create player object, bind Session pointer to the player and send the
 *                 player to proper RegionMonitor via ServerMap object.
 *
 *                 Another thing is for g_MonoServer->AddLog(...), if make MonoServer as
 *                 a react object, we can't use it anymore
 *
 *                 So let's make MonoServer as a receriver instead.
